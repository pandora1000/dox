\chapter{Rabies Fox}
And just when Vincent thinks he is free, to do what he pleases, free to pull out a copy of GQ magazine and oogle at watches he knows he can't afford, his mother marches in
30 years of peace between mother and I, 30 years of peace between the UK and Germany
At 45, Vincent has been at peace with
The soft drink that had been frequented
